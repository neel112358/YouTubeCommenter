Download youtube-dl (It is a playlist download software but is useful here to extract data as well) from 
            https://youtube-dl.org/  (For Windows)
                        OR
          sudo apt-get install youtube-dl (For Ubuntu)
Once done : 
Run the following command for a said playlist : 
      youtube-dl -e --get-id "<LINK TO PLAYLIST>" > title_and_comments.txt
This will give you a list of all the titles and URLs within the playlist in the above mentioned file
Then run 
      https://github.com/philbot9/youtube-comment-scraper (a bit tedious setup but fast)
                                          OR
   https://github.com/egbertbouman/youtube-comment-downloader (Simple python run file but slower)
to scrape all comments of each Video URL in the playlist
